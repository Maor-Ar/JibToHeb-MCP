# jibberish-to-hebrew-mcp

MCP server that converts text between “gibberish” English and Hebrew by swapping characters according to the **QWERTY ↔ Hebrew (SI 1452)** keyboard layout.

## Tools

- **qwerty_to_hebrew_text** — Converts English-looking gibberish (typed with Hebrew in mind but keyboard set to English) to Hebrew.
- **hebrew_to_qwerty_text** — Converts Hebrew text to the equivalent QWERTY key sequence.

## Install and run

```bash
pip install jibberish-to-hebrew-mcp
jibberish-to-hebrew-mcp
```

Or with [uv](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv):

```bash
uvx jibberish-to-hebrew-mcp
```

## Cursor / Claude config

Add to your MCP config (e.g. `~/.cursor/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "jibberish-to-hebrew": {
      "command": "jibberish-to-hebrew-mcp",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

If the command is not on PATH, use the full path to the script or `uvx jibberish-to-hebrew-mcp` (with `"command": "uvx"`, `"args": ["jibberish-to-hebrew-mcp"]`).
