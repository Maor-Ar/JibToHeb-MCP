description: Use Jibberish–Hebrew MCP for layout conversion
globs: *.md, *.txt
---

When the user shares text that looks like English gibberish but might be Hebrew typed on an English keyboard (or vice versa), use the MCP tools:

- **qwerty_to_hebrew_text(text)** — Convert gibberish English → Hebrew (same key positions, SI 1452 layout).
- **hebrew_to_qwerty_text(text)** — Convert Hebrew → QWERTY key sequence (reverse mapping).

Prefer these tools over guessing or manual character replacement.
